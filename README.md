# LJC_wshop_forTalk - Demos to talk through at event

For presenting the LJC/JavaWorkshop.git Intro to Java workshop.

This mikebgx/LJC_wshop_forTalk repo is the T_nn (Talk) projects to go with the above, and consists of part-commented demos to talk through, uncommenting one step at a time.

Clone this and the main JavaWorkshop repo, then copy both into a new folder. Dont push the T_nn projects back into the JavaWorkshop repo.

Workshop attendees should just clone the main LJC/JavaWorkshop repo.
